RUN!!!

Anyway, the soundfonts you need for this are the UNDERTALE soundfont, the ultimate megadrive soundfont, the pizza tower soundfont(which is kinda obscure so im going to provide it here), the sonic 1 soundfont, the wario land 4 soundfont, and the gm dls remastered version 2.1 alternative soundfont.
samples will be placed here also

I recommend you download EVERYTHING before the project file itself so you don't have a headache trying to figure out which channel is which soundfont
